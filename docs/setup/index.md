## Setting up the Master Node

To get Rudl up and running, you have to setup the manager cluster
your own. Afterwards, cluster setup will be only one line. But let's start:

- Log into your server and install docker. 

- Download the [rudl-master-stack.yml](rudl-master-stack.yml) using curl:
  `curl -o rudl-master-stack.yml`

##### Full GitOps Management

Manage your cluster environment the same way you manage your Software: Using git repositories.
Use mature methods for reviews like merge-requests and protected
branches to manage your infrastructure the same way you manage
your codebase.

##### Keyless Infrastructure

The best way to secure a server is to not have access to it at
all. Rudl allows to provision a cluster without the need for
any privileged access at all.

##### Secretless Operations

Secrets are stored encrypted within your GitOps repository. Using
asynchronous encryption, administrators can create secrets whithout
the possibility to access them at all.

##### Collective Code Ownership

Allow anyone to review your infrastructure and cluster configuration
without impact on overall security.

##### +1 Security by design

Rudl is designed to have at least two systems to be compromised
before the system at a whole is compromised.

##### Full automated deployment

Rudl integrates with gitlab and github build pipeline. Roll out
Updates on the fly and reconfigure services without the need to
log into any system.

##### Atomic Clusters

Spin up new clusters with no effort. Migrate the load. Shutdown
old clusters.
